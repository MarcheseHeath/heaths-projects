## Hobby Projects

### [Science Calculator (Very Old)](../main/Science_Calculator)

* *Project type: Spyder (.py)*

A program that is capable of performing calculations for equations across many different subjects that rely on specified material property data. This is something I worked on to familiarize myself with some aspects of python coding.

### [DnD DM Terminal](../main/DnD_Terminal)

* *Project type: Arduino IDE (.ino)*

Device that can be used to perform multiple tasks that are common for a Dungeons and Dragons DM. This project incorporates a button matrix and 128x64 pixel OLED.

### [Birthday Box (for my spouse)](../main/Birthday_Box)

* *Project type: Arduino IDE (.ino)*

A box that can read user specified audio files from an SD card reader to play whatever sound is selected on the 16x2 LCD. The box is also programmed for the 'Dino Scroller' game to be played.

### [Digital Electronics Number Converter](../main/Digital_Converter)

* *Project type: Virtual Studio Code (.c)*

A simple program that can convert values between many different formats that are typical for digital electronics. (eg. Binary <-> Decimal, Binary <-> IEEE754, Decimal <-> Hexadecimal, etc.)

### [Music](../main/Music)

* *Project type: Music (.mp3)*

I will sometimes *try* to make music for fun. You are welcome to listen to it anytime.

## School Projects

### [ESET 269 Project](../main/ESET_269_Project)

* *Project type: Keil IDE (.c)*

Allows a user to interface to the MSP432 using a console window with several commands. The user can utilize UART protocol to read and write data, control several LEDs, and read the temperature of the MSP432.

### [ESET 349 Project](../main/ESET_349_Project)

* *Project type: Keil IDE (.s)*

A simple memory game that uses GPIO pins to accept button inputs, control several LEDs, and control a buzzer. The players must memorize and input a sequence of patterns that increase in complexity with each succesive level. The game provides visual and auditory feedback for wins or losses through LED patterns and buzzer sounds.

### [ESET 350 Project](../main/ESET_350_Project)

* *Project type: Analog Circuit*

This project applies the knowledge learned in my Analog Electronics course by utilizing properties of operational amplifiers, diodes, and transistors to create a simple analog piano that is capable of playing a range of notes.

### [MXET 300 Work](../main/MXET_300)

* *Project type: Virtual Studio Code (.py) and SCUTTLE Robotics Kit*

A collection of work done for my Mechantronics labs. The work includes labs that cover many topics on establishing a working mobile robot along with my course project.

### [MXET 375 Project](../main/MXET_375_Project)

* *Project type: Arduino IDE (.ino)*

A motorized double pendulum that was designed and constructed so that motion data could be measured to describe the system.
